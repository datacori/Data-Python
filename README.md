# Data-Python
# Learning Goals (2025-12-10)

This document summarizes my learning goals and notes from my Python study session.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Python concepts and basic data types (datatype, number, int, float)
- Learn about variables: meaning, declaration, and printing
- Practice writing functions and modularizing code

---

## What is Python?

- A formal language used to write software that runs computer systems  
- A programming language that allows humans to give instructions to computers

---

## Variables

A variable is a **storage location** that holds a value, along with a **symbolic name** to reference it.

### Variable Declaration & Printing

```python

# Example of declaring and printing a variable
x = 10
print(x)

Use the print() function to check if the value is correctly stored in a variable.

Data Types - Numbers

Integer (int): Whole numbers

Floating point (float): Numbers with decimal points

Checking Data Type
x = 10
y = 3.14
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))  # <class 'float'>

Conversion & Math Functions
int_value = int(3.7)       # Convert to integer
float_value = float(5)     # Convert to float

abs_val = abs(-10)          # Absolute value
power_val = pow(2, 3)       # 2 to the power of 3

Arithmetic Operations

Addition: +

Subtraction: -

Multiplication: *

Division: /

Additional operators:

Modulus: %

Floor division: //

Exponentiation: **

a = 7
b = 3
print(a + b)  # 10
print(a - b)  # 4
print(a * b)  # 21
print(a / b)  # 2.3333...
print(a % b)  # 1
print(a // b) # 2
print(a ** b) # 343

Key Learnings

Learned the basics of Python and variables

Practiced writing functions


Reflections

As a non-IT major attempting to transition into a tech career, I signed up for a bootcamp

I started learning Python 3 weeks before the bootcamp to build a foundation

Goal: Watch 2-3 lectures per day, summarize, and review

Mindset: No giving up before trying! Keep going!
