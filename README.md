# Data-Python
# Python Basics

This project summarizes my Python learning goals and notes.

## Learning Goals

- Understand Python concepts and basic data types (int, float)
- Learn about variables: declaration, printing
- Practice writing functions

---

## What is Python?

- A formal language to write software for computer systems  
- A programming language that allows humans to give instructions to computers

---

## Variables

A variable is a **storage location** that holds a value, along with a **symbolic name**.

### Example


```python
# Declaring and printing a variable
x = 10
print(x)

```

---
Data Types - Numbers

Integer (int): Whole numbers

Floating point (float): Numbers with decimal points

```python
x = 10
y = 3.14
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))  # <class 'float'>
```

---
Conversion & Math Functions

```python
int_value = int(3.7)
float_value = float(5)
abs_val = abs(-10)
power_val = pow(2, 3)
```

---
Arithmetic Operations

Addition: +

Subtraction: -

Multiplication: *

Division: /

Modulus: %

Floor division: //

Exponentiation: **

Example

```python
a = 7
b = 3
print(a + b)  # 10
print(a - b)  # 4
print(a * b)  # 21
print(a / b)  # 2.3333...
print(a % b)  # 1
print(a // b) # 2
print(a ** b) # 343
```

## Key Learnings

Learned the basics of Python and variables

Practiced writing simple functions

---

## Reflections

As a non-IT major attempting a career change, I joined a bootcamp

Started Python 3 weeks before bootcamp for a head start

Goal: Watch 2-3 lectures per day, summarize, and review

Mindset: No giving up before trying! Keep going!
